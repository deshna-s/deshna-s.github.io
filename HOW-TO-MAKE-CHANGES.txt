1. First make changes and commit it to the master branch

2. Run npm run deploy - this will run on machine and make new changes published on the gh-pages branch 

3. After that is done, it will change the Github Pages Settings where we can see deshnashah.com

4. Change the custom domain and if empty make it deepfuriya.com

5. Wait for some time and we can see the changes on the server....
